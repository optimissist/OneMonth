        <h6>Welcome to my third One Month Responsive Design project</h6>

        <p>
          This is a website that shows some of the things I've learned in the One Month Responsive Design course. I took this course because I LOVE my job as a CMS web developer and wanted to learn more.
        </p>

        <p>
        So I am learning about how <a class="standout" href="https://www.onemonth.com" target="_blank">One Month</a> and <a class="standout" href="https://twitter.com/castig?lang=en" target="_blank">Chris Castiglione</a> approach responsive design and I have learned a whole bunch. It's been a lot of fun and educational. I would highly recommend it. But I am also really shy so there's that.

      <h2>Why This Site?</h2>
       <p>
        I'm creating this site so that I can share what I learned from <a class="standout" href="https://www.onemonth.com" target="_blank">One Month</a> and become a better teacher
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be asking yourself, <span class="italic">Self, what did she learn?</span> Well, let me tell you a bit about it...
      </p>

      <p>
        Responsive web design is an easy yet inclusive approach to web design to ensure your site looks good on a variety of screen sizes. This means that with one HTML document and some special css, you can design a website that can look good at 1020px and 680px.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may call me crazy. You might call this witchcraft. But it's really just responsive design. There are three key ingredients. First you need a <a class="standout" href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-designs-and-css-custom-properties-building-a-flexible-grid-system/" target="_blank">flexible grid</a>. This means the columns can expand or contract depending on the size of the screen. Second you need <a class="standout" href="https://responsivedesign.is/guidelines/flexible-images-and-media/" target="_blank">flexible media</a>. This will adjust images so they look right on the page, no matter the size. Last but certainly not least, you need <a class="standout" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp" target="_blank"> media queries</a>. This is a way to tailor css to specific screens and sizes using the same html base.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using media queries, a flexible grid and flexible images, you can develop a site that can look good on a Macbook and a Pixel.
